# Skull-Defect-Classification-and-Preprocessing
Skull defects are abnormalities or structural irregularities in the skull that can occur due to various factors, including trauma, congenital conditions, or surgical interventions. Accurate classification of skull defects is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of patients.
In this project, we aim to develop an AI-based system for skull defect classification by leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques.
The project involves two main stages: preprocessing of the medical imaging data and the subsequent classification of skull defects.

Steps involved in this are-
1. Conversion of NRRD dataset to NII format.
2. Preprocessing of converted NII dataset.
3. Extracting features from preprocessed images.
4. Classification of extracted features using K means clustering.
5. Plot the number of clusters.
